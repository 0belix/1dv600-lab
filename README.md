# 1dv600-lab
This is the upstream repo of labs in the course 1dv600, here you find the common code (client), api documentation and assignments in the wiki.

The repo has two main branches node and java, with the vagrant and server code. You should fork/download the respective branch depending on what you prefer working on.

## Node getting started
In your terminal:

1. Clone the repo
2. *cd 1dv600-lab*
3. Run *vagrant up* - this will install the vagrant box for the project.
4. Once the install script is done ssh into the machine (*vagrant ssh*)
5. Run the start script *npm start* - this starts a watcher process that restarts everytime a file is updated.
6. Happy coding
